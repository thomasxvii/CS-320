How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

- I can ensure my work is functional and secure by performing various tests like JUnit. These tests consist of checking every function in place, verifying that incorrect inputs cannot be received. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

- User needs directly incorporate into the functions that are made. This is especially apparent when creating test cases, as these needs provide great insight into what the user plans on using the program for. 

How do I approach designing software?

- I approach desiging software with the client at the forefront of my mind. All of their requests, needs, and restrictions are used to create the base structure of the code. After initial creation, I implement tests to see where the program fails, then modify the code until every line is working as intended.
